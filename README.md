# RockGame
rock, paper, scissors game.  Project to test Javascript i have been learning.

Javascript:
I re-wrote the code so each button has its own function.  Spent too long trying to get my original function to activate for each seperate button.  Something i should revisit in the future. Maybe i was over-thinking it!

CSS:
Spent alot of time playing with the images to get them to fit the button size better. Got very sidetracked with the button effects but enjoyed it! 

to do::
1) make the images fit the button, or atleast round off the top edges.
2) add an effect win the buttons are disabled.
3) make <div gameText> render even before text is there (stop the screen jump)
4) make the buttons/images better, ideally a uniformed size.
5) more style to the Win/Lose <box1>.

## images wouldnt load until i used the dev tools to find a solution.  add'ing /tree/main/ to the <src> worked. (so they refrence github location)

# RockGame
rock, paper, scissors game.  Project to test Javascript i have been learning.

Javascript:
I re-wrote the code so each button has its own function.  Spent too long trying to get my original function to activate for each seperate button.  Something i should revisit in the future.

CSS:
Spent alot of time playing with the images to get them to fit the button size better. Got very sidetracked with the button effects but enjoyed it! 

mobile responsive:
remade the ui for a mobile first responsive design and scale it up from there to monitors.
